A BioSegment instance should be run using the [instructions](/contributing/developer-guide/#running-locally). The administrator of this instance can give you account credentials and a access URL e.g. `https://biosegment.ugent.be`. The default URL used in the documentation is `localhost`.

## Log in

Open the URL in your webbrowser. This will direct you to a login interface. Use your account credentials to log in.
